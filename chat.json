I see. Yes, it has never made the connection that unknown_c8 = flash, but the connection is quite subtle. The model would have to be aware that the item on screen is an item that is not in memory and then deduce that it is therefore unknown_c8. Although this seems simple to us, I imagine LLMs would have to be much smarter to make this distinction consistently</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"f30fc863-26fc-4904-9393-7ca988d6396a\", 9793)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>2:43:13</button><span id='f30fc863-26fc-4904-9393-7ca988d6396a'><span class='hover' hovertext='OWL All-Access Pass 2019'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/overwatch-league-insider_2019A/2.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #B22222'>negima_sensei</span>: @Brandis41 Context Clear that he does occasionally.</span>","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"75d28986-7ff6-498c-9221-3d225a4d87c2\", 9802)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>2:43:22</button><span id='75d28986-7ff6-498c-9221-3d225a4d87c2'><span style='color: #8A2BE2'>namdnasrm</span>: @choppyer he&#39;s in fact quite capable of making that connection and has done so often, just never writes it down</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"011a9c82-a71b-42db-b051-c69e458d8c18\", 9832)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>2:43:52</button><span id='011a9c82-a71b-42db-b051-c69e458d8c18'><span class='hover' hovertext='Prime Gaming'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/premium/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF69B4'>Silver007xx</span>: @namdnasrm you just agreed that the tooling is at fault, and then you somehow think a new model will help? that if anything is a wild assumption</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"2a9bcc45-7e57-4e71-83a2-33a2a8f83b80\", 9859)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>2:44:19</button><span id='2a9bcc45-7e57-4e71-83a2-33a2a8f83b80'><span class='hover' hovertext='Share the Love'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles2/master/chatassets/badges/share-the-love/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #35E619'>choppyer</span>: @namdnasrm Oh, really?
